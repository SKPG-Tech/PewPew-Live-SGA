# PewPew-Live-SGA
A [PewPew Live](https://pewpew.live/) lua mesh that has the Standard Galactic Alphabet. 

## Why make it?
It was made purely just for the fun of it and as a learning project. It is not meant to be something big that everyone uses. It includes my crappy lua code, so please don't judge me, that's why I made it to learn lua and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) better.

## How To Use
Taking a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/SKPG-Tech/PewPew-Live-SGA/wiki) will get you started easily with no issues.

## How was it made?
Everything was modelled in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and exported to a single lua mesh called `SGA_Letters.lua` using the great [ModEngineer](https://github.com/ModEngineer)'s Blender add-on.
